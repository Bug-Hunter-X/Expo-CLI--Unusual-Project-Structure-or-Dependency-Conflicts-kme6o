# Expo CLI: Unusual Project Structure or Dependency Conflicts

This repository demonstrates a scenario where uncommon file structure or dependency issues can cause problems when using the Expo CLI.

## Bug Description:

The Expo CLI encounters unexpected errors due to a non-standard project setup. This can manifest in various ways, from build failures to unexpected runtime behavior. In some cases, even simple commands like `expo start` might fail.

## Reproducing the Bug:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Attempt to run `expo start`.
3. Observe the specific error message generated by the Expo CLI.

## Solution:

The solution involves analyzing your project's structure and dependencies to identify the root cause.  Common causes and solutions include:

* **Multiple `app.json` files:** Ensure you have only one `app.json` file located in the root directory of your project.
* **Non-standard build system:** Adjust your build system to align with Expo's requirements or use a standard build process.
* **Conflicting dependencies:** Review your `package.json` file for potential version conflicts or outdated packages. Use tools like `npm-check-updates` to identify and update outdated packages.
* **Incorrect file paths:** Double check all file paths in your configuration files, especially those used by Expo.
