The solution depends on the specific cause of the error, which is often revealed in the error message.

**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Check the error message carefully.** The error message will often pinpoint the exact location or issue.
2. **Verify the project structure.** Ensure that your project follows the standard Expo project structure.
3. **Inspect `package.json`:** Carefully examine your dependencies for conflicts or outdated packages.
4. **Clean and reinstall dependencies:** Try `npm cache clean --force` and then reinstall the packages using `npm install`.
5. **Simplify the project:** Create a minimal, reproducible project to isolate the problem.  This helps pinpoint the exact cause and helps you create a minimal example for reporting to Expo if you cannot find a solution.

**Example (Illustrative):**

If the problem is a dependency conflict, you might see the following code fix:

```javascript
// Assuming the conflict is with package 'react-native-vector-icons'

//Before:
//"react-native-vector-icons": "^6.4.0"
//After:
//"react-native-vector-icons": "^7.1.0" // Updated to a compatible version
```

Remember to always consult the Expo documentation and community forums for assistance.
